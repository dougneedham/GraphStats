Description: Pass in a graph object, and three data frames are created: gs.node,gs.edge,gs.graph.
  These dataframes will ultimately contain the following statistics:
    Node data frame structure:
      NodeLabel,In,Out,Degree,PR,Modularity Class,BetweenNessCentrality,WeightedDegree,EigenvectorCentrality,Triangle
    Edge data frame structure:
      Edge_Label,Source,Target,Type,Weight
    Graph Data frame:
      Average Degree,Average Weighted Degree,Diameter, Density, Modularity, ConnectedComponents,AveragePathLength
